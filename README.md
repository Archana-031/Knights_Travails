# Knights_Travails

## Overview

This project is a C program that calculates the minimum number of moves required for a knight to travel from a starting position to a target position on an 8x8 chessboard. It implements two algorithms:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - Finds the shortest path in an unweighted grid.
2. **A* Search** - Finds the shortest path using a heuristic to guide the search.

## Features

-> **Manual Solve**: Enter starting and target positions to calculate the number of moves.
-> **AI Solve**: Automatically generate random starting and target positions and calculate the number of moves.
-> **Chessboard Display**: Visualize the knight's moves on the chessboard.
